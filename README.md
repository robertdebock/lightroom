# Installing lightroom-templates
Place these templates [as descirbed here by Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/preference-file-locations-lightroom-41.html). (Don't worry, that page described how to do it for Adobe Lightroom 5, but Adobe Lightroom 6 also uses these paths.

# What these templates do
Some of the templates have been designed to work on any file, but some specifically work well with the Fujifilm X-Trans sensor. (X-Pro1, X-E1, X-E2, X-T1, X100s, X100t. I only have the X-Pro1 and X100t though.

## Dehaze
For the people that bought the perpetual license of Adobe Lightroom (as opposed to the Creative Cloud version), you can now use the de-haze feature. There are templates for 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90 and 100%. Be sure to also use these templates on images that are not so hazy/misty. Works great for skies for example.
