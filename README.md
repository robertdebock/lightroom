# lightroom-templates
Some of the Adobe Lightroom templates I use.
Place these templates [as descirbed here by Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/preference-file-locations-lightroom-41.html). (Don't worry, that page described how to do it for Adobe Lightroom 5, but Adobe Lightroom 6 also uses these paths.
