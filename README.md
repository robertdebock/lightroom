# Installing lightroom settings
This repository contains a settings that can be used in Lightroom. Some are generic and can be used for any camera, others are camera specific.

## Using a package
Please download [a package containing all Lightroom settings](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/lr-robertdebock/lr-robertdebock-1.0.0.dmg).

## Templates
Place these templates [as descirbed here by Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/preference-file-locations-lightroom-41.html). (Don't worry, that page described how to do it for Adobe Lightroom 5, but Adobe Lightroom 6 also uses these paths.

Once installed, these templates can be applied to any photo in the Develop module, under Presets. A restart of Lightroom is required after installing.

### Dehaze templates
For the people that bought the perpetual license of Adobe Lightroom (as opposed to the Creative Cloud version), you can now use the de-haze feature. There are templates for 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90 and 100%. Be sure to also use these templates on images that are not so hazy/misty. Works great for skies for example.
*Lightroom 6.1 is required to make these templates work.*

## Camera profiles
For a few camera's I have create color profiles using a X Rite Color Checker Passport. That's a calibration tool, to inform Lightroom how the color condition were during a shoot.
Place those color profiles [as described here by X Rite](https://www.xrite.com/i1display-pro/support/kb3182).

Once installed, in the Develop module, under Camera Calibration, the appropriate color profile can be selected.
